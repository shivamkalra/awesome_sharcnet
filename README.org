** Bootstrap python2.7 environment on Sharcnet

Following will build python2.7 using gcc compiler.

- Download [[scripts/install_python2.7.8][python bootstrap script]] in your home directory and execute it.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd ~
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shivamkalra/awesome_sharcnet/master/scripts/install_python2.7.8
  chmod +x ~/install_python2.7.8
  ~/install_python2.7.8
#+END_SRC

- It will install python2.7.8 and pip in *~/.python2.7.8*.

- Make sure, you do not load any python modules in your .bashrc. Add following
  to your .bashrc.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  module unload gcc python intel openmpi
  module load gcc

  export PYPATH="$HOME/.python2.7.8"
  export PATH=${PYPATH}/bin:${PATH}
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PYPATH}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
  export -n LDFLAGS
#+END_SRC

- Re login or source .bashrc and you will have locally build python environment
  activated.

- Use ~pip~ to install ~virtualenv~ and install your favorite packages in
  virtual environment. You can source this virtual environment from your job
  submission script.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  pip install virtualenv

  # create virtual environment (it just creates a folder in directory of execution)
  virtualenv irma-playground

  # activate your virtual environment
  source irma-playground/bin/activate
#+END_SRC
